# Performance Study of iOS App Development Frameworks

This repository contains the source code and results of a performance study comparing UIKit and SwiftUI frameworks for iOS app development. The study aims to evaluate the speed, memory usage, and battery consumption of apps developed using these two frameworks. Three identical iOS apps were created: one using UIKit, another using SwiftUI exclusively, and a third app with SwiftUI views embedded in a UIViewController. The performance tests were conducted on different devices using Instruments' CPU Profiler.

## Project Links

- [UIKit App](https://github.com/namaswic/InfiniteScrollingWithUIKit) - Source code of the app developed using UIKit.
- [SwiftUI App](https://github.com/namaswic/InfiniteScrollWithSwiftUI) - Source code of the app developed using SwiftUI.
- [SwiftUI in UIViewController](https://github.com/namaswic/InfiniteScrollingWithUIViewControllerAndSwiftUI) - Source code of the app developed using SwiftUI views embedded in a UIViewController.

## Survey Result

The survey result file can be found in the [Survey Results](survey_results.csv) CSV file. The survey collected data from iOS developers regarding their experiences and opinions on adopting SwiftUI and UIKit in their app development projects.
